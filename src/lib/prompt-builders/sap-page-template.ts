Link the name to the matching Pages URL when inventory has it: <a href="EXACT_URL" title="EXACT_PAGE_TITLE">anchor</a>. Forbidden: inventing an offering the site does not provide. Forbidden: hardcoded product lists from another trade.
5. **Best for:** One reader job-to-be-done for THIS trade in THIS place, derived from keyword + sourced local conditions + offerings. Not a restatement of the product name. Not a copied job list from another industry.
6. **Budget:** Sourced range with explicit CAD or USD and a unit when FIRST-PARTY / VERIFIED FACTS / audit provide figures. Qualify as illustrative. If no price source: "Quote; varies with {named drivers}". Forbidden: invented dollar ranges.
7. **Reason:** One sourced local condition or trade constraint that explains why this offering fits that job here. Forbidden: generic benefits that would work on any city page.
8. Rows: 4-6. Each row a different Best-for job. Product may repeat only when Reason differs.
9. Article table cap: this table plus What We Offer are the only two [TABLE] slots. [DECISION] must not add a third [TABLE].`;
