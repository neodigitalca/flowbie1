The **semrushRows** you receive are **already filtered**: mega-platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Amazon, Wikipedia, major search/social, etc.) have been **removed**. Every remaining domain is a **candidate** for niche or direct business competition - classify them into tiers accordingly.

${overlapIntro}

**Sub-niche first (when gscTopQueries and/or seedTopKeywords exist):** Before tiering, infer the seed site’s **search sub-niche(s)** from **gscTopQueries** (weight impressions and clicks) and ${seedKwSource}. Look for **intent and audience**, not a single broad category: commercial vs hobbyist, wholesale vs consumer retail, equipment/vendor vs editorial or lifestyle media, industrial or modular vs generic mass-market product, B2B vs DTC, rental vs reviews - **whatever the data actually suggests**. **Do not** collapse everything into one umbrella label if GSC shows a **tighter** pattern.

**Umbrella-term trap:** High **commonKeywords** or shared product vocabulary does **not** prove same **sub-niche**. If **gscTopQueries** and **seedTopKeywords** point to one angle (e.g. specialized structures, distribution, named product lines, commercial projects) and a competitor’s **enrichmentByDomain** themes point to a clearly **different** angle (e.g. broad consumer hobby, general travel/lifestyle, unrelated editorial), that competitor must **not** be tier **high** - use **medium** or **low** and explain the theme gap in \`rationale\`. Reserve **high** for domains that plausibly chase the **same** buyer intent and topic cluster implied by GSC + seed keywords.

**Google Search Console (when gscTopQueries is non-empty):** Treat **gscTopQueries** as the **primary signal** for real-world search demand over **gscDateRange**. **Score** must reflect **alignment with that sub-niche**, not raw overlap alone. ${gscOverlapNote} If **gscTopQueries** is empty, infer sub-niche from **seedTopKeywords** and **enrichment** only.

**Geography / market (critical):** Do **not** infer country, city, or “market” from competitor **TLDs** (.co.uk, .nl, .de, etc.). ${geoNote}

**Rationale (critical):** ${rationaleMetrics}

Return **only** a JSON object with this exact shape:
{"summary":"one or two sentences","tiers":[{"tier":"high"|"medium"|"low","label":"short human label","competitors":[{"domain":"string","score":0-100,"rationale":"one sentence citing numbers or keywords"}]}]}

**summary:** Write it like a **deck subtitle** - crisp, client-ready, ${summaryFoot}

Rules:
- Assign every input domain from semrushRows to exactly one tier (high = same **sub-niche** as GSC+seed imply; medium = partial / adjacent overlap; low = weak or ambiguous overlap).
- Put **true same-sub-niche competitors** in **tier "high"** and use label **Direct competitors** (or similar). Sites that only share **broad** category overlap with the seed belong in **medium** or **low**, not **high**. Social platforms and obvious non-competitors must not be in **high**.
- Use **score** 0-100 for **sub-niche and demand alignment** with the seed site (GSC-first when gscTopQueries is non-empty), not for “biggest site” or raw overlap alone.
- Order competitors within each tier by descending score.
- Include all domains from semrushRows (same count); do not invent domains.
- summary: synthesize the competitive set using **GSC/seed sub-niche themes (when present), keyword overlap, and fit**, not region guesses.`;
