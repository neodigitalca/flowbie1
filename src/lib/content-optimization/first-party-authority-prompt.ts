1. **Numbers that mean something**: When the topic involves measurable specs, cost, ROI, savings, payback, or production (efficiency %, kWh, kW, CAD/USD, COP, R-value, SEER, rebates, degradation, etc.), include sourced figures with units and explicit currency (CAD for Canadian sites, USD for US sites — infer from connected service area, province/state, or site country; never bare "$" without CAD or USD). Cost/ROI/savings H2s must carry at least two distinct sourced data points when sources provide them (range + driver, or two drivers). Present install and $/W figures as illustrative ranges, not universal prices: qualify with variance drivers (system size, equipment, roof complexity, electrical work, market timing, location). Never invent specs or dollar amounts; if missing from sources, state what drives variance and what to verify.
2. **Regional climate H2**: When ARTICLE CONTENT TYPE is cost or how_to, exactly one H2 must explain how the connected service area's climate/seasons affect the decision (production, comfort, timing, durability, snow, humidity, freeze-thaw, etc.) using only facts from sources. Not a generic national overview. For guide, what_is, and vs: skip a dedicated climate H2; spend that slot on process, comparison, metrics, or recommendation.
3. **Worth-the-extra-cost H2**: When ARTICLE CONTENT TYPE is cost or how_to (or sources show product tiers), the [TRADEOFF] checklist item must answer whether the premium/higher-efficiency/higher-tier option is worth the extra cost for typical local readers, with constraints (roof, usage, budget, payback horizon, market, competition). No vague "it depends" without criteria. For guide, what_is, and vs without tiers: [TRADEOFF] is when the approach fails or who it is not for, not a fake premium product tier.
4. **No generic filler**: Replace encyclopedia prose with reader decisions, side-by-side comparisons, and field examples from FIRST-PARTY / audit / existing HTML. Forbidden: repeated generic benefits, textbook definitions, restating the Answer definition, copy any site could publish.`;

/** A+ keyword spine: place is a modifier; practitioner knowledge, intent examples, human voice, sourced we-lines. */
export const A_PLUS_KEYWORD_AUTHORITY_RULE = `**A+ KEYWORD AUTHORITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
The writing keyword is the article's subject. Place names, the connected business, and SEO mechanics are supporting context. Derive every requirement from the writing keyword and listed sources. Never from a hardcoded vertical.
1. **Place-entity density (~70% cut)**: When a place entity (street, neighborhood, district, landmark) is present, it is a location modifier, not the topic. Exact entity name at most once per body H2 (skip if the prior H2 already used it); article-wide at most ~3 exact mentions in prose (Answer may use it once). After the first mention prefer here / this area / local. Forbidden: making the place name the grammatical subject of most paragraphs; repeating "{keyword} {entity}" slug stacks; writing a place-history page with the keyword bolted on. If no place entity is present, skip this item. City/region still obeys SERVICE AREA DENSITY.
2. **Keyword-specific practitioner knowledge**: Each body H2 must include at least one fact, constraint, process step, spec, mistake, or decision that a knowledgeable provider for THIS writing keyword would know, taken from FIRST-PARTY CLAIMS, VERIFIED FACTS, audit blocks, existing HTML, or the keyword's meaning. Forbidden: generic local-page filler that would work for any service at this place; encyclopedia of the place; copy that never names a decision unique to the keyword.
3. **Concrete search-intent examples**: In Overview or the first body H2 (no new H2), include 2-3 concrete searcher questions or query examples implied by the writing keyword. Use peopleAlsoAsk / related searches from the SEO brief when present; otherwise paraphrase the decision behind the keyword. Shape: short query plus what the searcher is trying to decide. Forbidden: abstract labels only (informational / commercial intent) with no example queries. Do not invent SERP queries that are not implied by the keyword or brief.
4. **No AI / programmatic voice**: Write as a practitioner answering the keyword, not a template filling slots. Forbidden: slug stacks; "residents of {entity} need {keyword}"; identical sentence stems across paragraphs; knowledge-graph SPO lists or labeled triples; "this article explores"; repeating the writing keyword as the subject of consecutive sentences; H2s that only swap the place name. Vary rhythm. SPO (if used as a planning aid) must read as natural prose.
5. **First-hand connected-business evidence**: Tie 2-4 sourced we/company observations to the writing keyword's job (what we see when serving this searcher), using FIRST-PARTY CLAIMS, audit blocks, GBP, or existing HTML. Use the connected business name from the identity block. Forbidden: hollow "our team"; inventing case studies; NAP/address dumping as expertise; expertise about the place with no keyword job. If no sourced claim exists, use qualitative we-voice with a named decision constraint; never invent campaigns or metrics.
6. **No unsubstantiated local expertise**: "we understand [place] architecture / needs / market" is invalid unless the same paragraph names a sourced local condition (housing era or style, street or exposure pattern, season, building constraint) from listed sources. If sources lack that condition, omit the claim. Do not invent styles, projects, or businesses.`;

/** AISO depth: definitive answers with sourced numbers, comparisons, regional facts, field expertise. */

1. **Direct answer first**: Open each section with the answer to its H2 (process, comparison, metrics, who it is for, cost, ROI, savings, payback, eligibility, timeline), not a topic definition or history lesson. Forbidden: restating the article Answer definition in a body H2.
2. **Sourced numbers**: When VERIFIED FACTS, SEO brief, FIRST-PARTY CLAIMS, ChatGPT facts, LLM/DFS audit, or existing HTML contain figures, place confirmed figures prominently in the matching section with units plus explicit currency (CAD for Canada, USD for United States). Qualify cost/$/W/ROI ranges as illustrative when Tier 2. One plain-language "so what" sentence per figure. Cost/ROI/savings headings: at least two distinct confirmed data points when VERIFIED FACTS provides them. Property-value claims allowed when CONFIRMED or Tier 2 illustrative with qualification. Never invent figures. If no Tier 1/2 source for one claim, name drivers for that claim only.
3. **Comparisons**: Include at least one A-vs-B or tier comparison somewhere in the article when the topic has options (battery vs no battery, lease vs buy, MURB vs single-family, premium vs standard, national vs local, in-house vs agency).
4. **Regional specificity**: Programs, rates, incentives, climate effects, market patterns, and campaign or install patterns must name Alberta or the connected service area when sources support them. Forbidden: generic national copy when local sources exist.
5. **First-hand expertise**: Each body section includes FIELD OBSERVATION (city or here + named constraint + we see / we recommend when) from listed claims or audit blocks when available. Named constraint matches this site's trade (campaign scope, market, budget, competition; or install constraints when the topic is physical product). Forbidden: hollow "our team" lines without that detail.
6. **Budget use**: Spend the article word budget on sourced detail (examples, comparison rows, regional program facts, process steps, metrics), not repeated generic benefits or dictionary restatement.
7. **No concept repetition**: State each core idea once per article unless a later section adds new data. Forbidden: restating the same benefit or the Answer definition in Overview and multiple body H2s. Replace repeated explanatory sentences with the next distinct fact.`;

1. **Natural phrasing (no SEO stubs)**: Forbidden in body copy: dangling tails "for more", "learn more", "read more", or "click here" when not part of a complete natural sentence. Forbidden broken patterns: [noun phrase] for more with no clear object (e.g. "initial cost for more", "energy future for more"). Internal and external links must stay mid-sentence with words before and after the anchor; never append a link or stub phrase after the final period.
2. **Conclusion requires mechanism**: Any strong recommendation or regional benefit claim must name at least one cause in the same paragraph (roof area limit, annual sun hours, winter sun angle, temperature coefficient, snow cover, payback horizon, usage pattern, etc.). Forbidden: standalone conclusions ("X is particularly beneficial here") with no because tied to a measurable or observable factor from sources.
3. **Technical accuracy (no spec conflation)**: Do not equate unrelated specs: panel efficiency vs partial-shading tolerance vs low-light or diffuse-light performance vs temperature coefficient vs inverter/optimizer/string layout. Forbidden: implying higher-efficiency panels solve shading, "perform better in sub-optimal conditions" when shade is the issue, that efficiency ratings mitigate shading losses, or that high efficiency automatically means better low-light performance. Forbidden blanket pros: "better performance in low light conditions" or "better in low light" as a default pro of high-efficiency tiers. When low light matters, use conditional wording (e.g. some high-efficiency panels may perform well under lower-light conditions, depending on module technology and design) or name the driver (cell type, bifacial gain, low-light current, etc.) when sources support it. When shading matters, name the actual drivers (MLPE/optimizers, string layout, bypass diodes, tree/structure obstructions, layout changes) — not buying a higher-efficiency module as the fix unless sources explicitly tie them. Prefer qualified, source-bound statements over broad superlatives.
4. **Qualified claims (no blanket pros)**: Pros/cons tables, comparison tables, and benefit lists must not use unqualified universal claims. Use may / can / when / depending on / for models that plus a named factor or source. Each Pros row should carry one specific, verifiable angle, not a generic superlative.
5. **Premium spec ≠ economics**: System-selection and investment tables must separate when a higher-rated spec helps (limited space, tight performance target) from when a standard tier may yield better economics (ample space, cost-sensitive budget). Forbidden row logic: fastest ROI, fastest payback, or best value → choose highest rated spec/tier without cost and payback caveats. Efficiency vs ROI is one instance of this rule, not the only case.
6. **Comfort and energy hedging**: When the topic touches energy bills, heating/cooling load, or shade-driven comfort, use may / can / help / potentially plus variance drivers (window orientation, glazing, schedule, climate, shade type). Forbidden: guaranteed bill reduction, significant long-term savings, or pays for itself without depends-on framing. Match FAQ-level caution in body prose and recommendations.`;

5. **Compact**: Intro 1-2 sentences; blockquote 2-3 sentences; recommendation p 2 sentences max.
