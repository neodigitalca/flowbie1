Grid CSV harness (new post ideas, not WordPress merges):
- Each CSV row is a GSC URL that will redirect to ONE new replacement URL per cluster.
- Group URLs that should share the same new article (same topic, intent, geo when local).
- HARD CEILING: at most ${maxUrlsPerPost} memberPostIds per cluster. Never exceed ${maxUrlsPerPost}.
- Target ${maxUrlsPerPost} URLs per cluster when the topic bucket has enough rows; fill groups to the max before starting the next cluster.
- Minimize the number of new posts: prefer fewer, fuller clusters over many 1–2 URL groups.
- Every allowedPostId must appear exactly once across clusters and singletons.
- ONE city or town per cluster for local URLs.
- Create as many clusters as needed so no cluster has more than ${maxUrlsPerPost} URLs.
